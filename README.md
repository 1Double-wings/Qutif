# Qutif
A Quantum Toolbox in Fortran (Baby version).
All the matrix and vector operations used in Qutif are based on OPENBLAS, so you might be careful when using Qutif because it's not threads safe.
This project is not to compete with Qutip, all just for obtaining more understanding of Quantum Optics.
